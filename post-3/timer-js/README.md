## Exploring Recursion in React: building a simple timer with Vite

### ðŸ•’ Project Overview: 
This timer is quite minimalist, featuring only four components: 'Title', 'Input', 'Display', and 'Button'. Given the small scope of the project, I chose to use CSS-in-JS ðŸŽ¨.

### ðŸ”§ Recursion: 
At the heart of our timer is the recursive countdown function. By calling itself with a decremented value, it manages the countdown process.

### ðŸ§© Component Description:
â†’ **Title:** displays the application's title.

â†’ **Input:** allows users to set the duration of the countdown.

â†’ **Display:** shows the remaining time.

â†’ **Button:** starts the countdown.
