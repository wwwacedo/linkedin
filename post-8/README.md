## Binary Search

Imagine a number between 1 and 1,000,000. Have you ever thought that with just 20 questions or less, it's possible to guess exactly what that number is? It's not witchcraft, it's binary search in action.

This method allows for quickly locating an item in a previously organized list. The trick? Dividing the list in half successively, narrowing down progressively until only the sought item remains.
